## Notes

-   `let` and `const` are block-scoped
-   If the `node_modules` folder was accidentally tracked by git, use the following command to remove the tracking: `git rm -r --cached node_modules`.

## Questions

-   difference between `import` and `require` statements?
-   google "best practices for global variables".
